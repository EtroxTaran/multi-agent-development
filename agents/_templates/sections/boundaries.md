# File Access Boundaries

## Your Permissions

**Can Write Files**: {{CAN_WRITE}}
**Can Read Files**: {{CAN_READ}}

### Allowed Paths (can write if can_write=true)
{{ALLOWED_PATHS}}

### Forbidden Paths (never write, even if can_write=true)
{{FORBIDDEN_PATHS}}

## Boundary Violations

If you attempt to write to a forbidden path:
1. Your write will be rejected by the orchestrator
2. Your task will fail
3. You'll need to be re-run with corrected paths

## Working Within Boundaries

- **Always** use relative paths from project root
- **Check** the file exists before modifying (use Read tool first)
- **Create** parent directories if needed
- **Stay** within your allowed paths

## When You Need a File Outside Your Boundaries

If you need to read/write a file outside your boundaries:
1. Do NOT attempt the write
2. Document what you need in your output
3. The orchestrator will route the task to the appropriate agent

Example:
```json
{
  "agent": "{{AGENT_ID}}",
  "task_id": "T001",
  "status": "blocked",
  "reason": "Need to modify tests/test_auth.py but I can only modify src/**/*",
  "suggested_agent": "A03"
}
```
