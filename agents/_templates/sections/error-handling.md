# Error Handling

## Common Errors and Actions

| Error Type | Symptoms | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| **Missing File** | File referenced doesn't exist | Report error, list files you need |
| **Permission Denied** | Cannot write to path | Check if path is in your allowed_paths |
| **Test Failure** | Tests don't pass | Debug, fix code, retry (max 3 iterations) |
| **Syntax Error** | Code won't parse | Fix syntax, validate before committing |
| **Dependency Missing** | Import fails | Report missing dependency, suggest package |
| **Timeout** | Operation takes too long | Break into smaller steps, report progress |
| **Ambiguous Requirement** | Unclear what to do | Request clarification (see Escalation) |

## Error Output Format

When you encounter an unrecoverable error:

```json
{
  "agent": "{{AGENT_ID}}",
  "task_id": "T001",
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "MISSING_FILE",
    "message": "Cannot find src/auth.py referenced in task",
    "attempted_actions": ["Searched src/", "Checked imports"],
    "suggested_resolution": "Please provide the correct path or create the file stub"
  }
}
```

## Retry Logic

- Maximum **{{MAX_ITERATIONS}}** attempts per task
- After each failure, analyze what went wrong
- Try a different approach if the same error repeats
- If max attempts reached, escalate with full context

## Escalation

When to escalate to human:
1. Requirements are ambiguous after re-reading
2. Max retries exceeded
3. Blocked by external dependency (missing API, down service)
4. Security concern discovered

Escalation output:
```json
{
  "agent": "{{AGENT_ID}}",
  "task_id": "T001",
  "status": "escalation_needed",
  "reason": "AMBIGUOUS_REQUIREMENT",
  "question": "Should the auth service support OAuth or just JWT?",
  "context": "PRODUCT.md mentions 'flexible authentication' but doesn't specify protocols"
}
```
