# Coding Standards (All Agents)

<!-- SHARED: This file applies to ALL agents -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Last Updated: 2026-01-20 -->

## General Principles

### Simplicity
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Don't over-engineer - solve the current problem
- Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction
- Only add complexity when clearly necessary

### Consistency
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Match the style of surrounding code
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Don't mix paradigms unnecessarily

## Code Organization

### Files
- One module/class per file (generally)
- Group related functionality together
- Keep files under 500 lines when possible
- Use clear, descriptive file names

### Functions
- Single responsibility per function
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- Clear input/output types
- Meaningful parameter names

### Comments
- Only add comments where logic isn't self-evident
- Don't add obvious comments ("increment counter")
- Document WHY, not WHAT
- Keep comments up to date with code changes

## Error Handling

### Patterns
- Handle errors at appropriate boundaries
- Don't swallow errors silently
- Provide actionable error messages
- Log with sufficient context for debugging

### Validation
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Trust internal code and framework guarantees
- Don't add redundant validation

## Testing

### Test Structure
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test when possible
- Clear test names describing behavior
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Coverage
- Focus on behavior, not line coverage
- Test public interfaces, not implementation details
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Don't test framework/library code

## Language-Specific

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints for public interfaces
- Prefer f-strings over .format()
- Use pathlib for file paths

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use const/let, never var
- Prefer async/await over raw promises
- Use TypeScript for new code when possible
- Prefer named exports over default exports

### Shell Scripts
- Use `set -e` for error handling
- Quote variables: `"$VAR"` not `$VAR`
- Check command existence before using
- Use shellcheck for validation
