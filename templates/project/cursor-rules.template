# Cursor Rules for Code Review

## Project Overview
[Brief description of what this project does]

## Security Standards

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints must require authentication unless explicitly public
- Use principle of least privilege
- Validate JWT tokens on every request

### Input Validation
- Validate all user input at API boundaries
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS

### Sensitive Data
- Never log passwords, tokens, or PII
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## Code Quality Standards

### Error Handling
- All async operations must have error handling
- Use typed errors with meaningful messages
- Don't swallow errors silently

### Testing Requirements
- All new code must have tests
- Minimum 80% coverage on business logic
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

### Performance
- Database queries must be optimized
- Avoid N+1 query patterns
- Use pagination for list endpoints

## Review Checklist
When reviewing code, verify:
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and edge cases
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Logging doesn't expose sensitive data

## File Organization
- One component/class per file
- Group related files in directories
- Follow existing naming conventions

## Patterns to Follow
- [e.g., Repository pattern for data access]
- [e.g., Factory pattern for object creation]

## Anti-patterns to Avoid
- [e.g., God objects/classes]
- [e.g., Circular dependencies]
- [e.g., Magic numbers/strings]
