# Project Context for Gemini

## Project Overview
[Brief description of what this project does and its purpose]

## Architecture

### System Type
[e.g., Monolith, Microservices, Serverless, Modular Monolith]

### Key Components
- **[Component 1]**: [Description and responsibility]
- **[Component 2]**: [Description and responsibility]
- **[Component 3]**: [Description and responsibility]

### Data Flow
```
[User Request] -> [API Layer] -> [Service Layer] -> [Data Layer]
                      |               |
                      v               v
               [Validation]    [Business Rules]
```

## Design Principles
- [e.g., SOLID principles]
- [e.g., Domain-Driven Design]
- [e.g., Clean Architecture]

## Scalability Considerations
- [e.g., Horizontal scaling via load balancer]
- [e.g., Database read replicas for queries]
- [e.g., Caching strategy for frequently accessed data]

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: [e.g., < 200ms for API calls]
- **Throughput**: [e.g., 1000 requests/second]
- **Availability**: [e.g., 99.9% uptime]

## Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: [e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0]
- **Authorization**: [e.g., RBAC, ABAC]
- **Data Protection**: [e.g., Encryption at rest/transit]

## Integration Points
- **[External API 1]**: [Purpose and SLA]
- **[External API 2]**: [Purpose and SLA]

## Technical Debt to Avoid
- [e.g., Don't introduce circular dependencies]
- [e.g., Avoid N+1 queries]
- [e.g., Don't bypass the service layer]

## Review Focus Areas
When reviewing code, pay special attention to:
1. Architectural consistency with existing patterns
2. Scalability implications of new code
3. Performance characteristics
4. Proper separation of concerns
