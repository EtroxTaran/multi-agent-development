# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your project with **meta-architect** - a multi-agent AI development system.

## What You Have

Your project now includes:

```
your-project/
├── meta-architect/          # AI orchestration tools (submodule)
├── Documents/               # Put your project docs here
├── CLAUDE.md                # Claude's context (edit this!)
├── QUICKSTART.md            # This guide
└── .claude/                 # AI skills (symlinked)
```

## How It Works

**Claude is your Tech Lead** with access to specialized AI agents:

| Agent | Role | What It Does |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Claude** | Tech Lead | Coordinates everything, implements code |
| **Cursor** | Security Expert | Reviews for vulnerabilities, code quality |
| **Gemini** | Architect | Reviews design, scalability, patterns |

## Getting Started (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Your Documentation

Put your project context in `Documents/`:

```
Documents/
├── product-vision.md     # What you're building
├── architecture.md       # Technical decisions
└── requirements.md       # Detailed requirements
```

Or if you already know what you want, skip to Step 2.

### Step 2: Start Claude

```bash
claude
```

### Step 3: Use Skills

Tell Claude what you want to build, or use these commands:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/discover` | Claude reads your docs, helps create a spec |
| `/plan` | Creates a task breakdown for you to approve |
| `/task T1` | Implements one task at a time |
| `/status` | Shows progress |

## Recommended Workflow

### For New Features

```
1. Add docs to Documents/
2. Run: claude
3. Use: /discover
   → Claude reads docs, asks questions, creates PRODUCT.md

4. Use: /plan
   → Claude creates tasks, you approve

5. Use: /task T1
   → Claude implements with tests

6. Repeat: /task T2, T3, etc.

7. Use: /status
   → See your progress
```

### If You Already Have a Spec

```
1. Create PRODUCT.md with your feature spec
2. Run: claude
3. Use: /plan
4. Approve the plan
5. Use: /task T1 to start
```

## PRODUCT.md Format

If creating manually, include:

```markdown
# Feature Name

## Summary
What it does (50-500 chars)

## Problem Statement
Why it's needed (min 100 chars)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Example Inputs/Outputs

### Example 1
Input: ...
Output: ...

## Technical Constraints
- Performance requirements
- Security requirements
- Compatibility requirements

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] No security issues
```

## Customize Claude's Context

Edit `CLAUDE.md` to tell Claude about your project:

- Your tech stack (language, framework, database)
- Coding standards (naming, patterns)
- File structure
- Testing preferences

The more context you provide, the better Claude performs.

## Available Commands Reference

### Human-Guided (Recommended)

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/discover` | Read docs, create PRODUCT.md together |
| `/plan` | Create task breakdown, get your approval |
| `/task <id>` | Implement one task with TDD |
| `/status` | Check progress |

### Automated

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/orchestrate` | Run full automated workflow |
| `/validate` | Run security + architecture review on plan |
| `/verify` | Run code review after implementation |

### Utility

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/resolve-conflict` | When Cursor and Gemini disagree |
| `/phase-status` | Detailed phase information |

## Tips

### 1. Start Small

Break big features into small tasks. Claude works best with focused work:
- Each task: max 5 new files
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Independent when possible

### 2. Let Claude Ask Questions

Claude will ask when uncertain. Answer to improve results.

### 3. Review Plans Before Implementing

When Claude shows a plan, review it:
- Are tasks the right size?
- Is the order correct?
- Missing anything?

### 4. Check Progress Often

Use `/status` to see where you are. It helps Claude too.

### 5. Provide Good Context

The `CLAUDE.md` file is critical. Good context = better code.

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude doesn't understand my project"

→ Add more detail to `CLAUDE.md` and `Documents/`

### "Tasks are too big"

→ Ask Claude to split them, or use `/plan` again

### "Something went wrong mid-workflow"

→ Use `/status` to see state, then continue from there

### "Want to start over"

→ Delete `.workflow/` folder and start fresh
