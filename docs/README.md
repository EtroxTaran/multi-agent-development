## Current Documentation

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Quick Start](quick-start.md) | Step-by-step guide to create and run your first project |
| [README.md](../README.md) | Complete system reference with architecture details |
| [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) | Version history and release notes |

## Key Concepts

- **Nested Architecture**: Projects live in `projects/<name>/` with isolated context
- **LangGraph Workflow**: Graph-based orchestration with parallel execution
- **5-Phase Process**: Planning -> Validation -> Implementation -> Verification -> Completion
- **Task-Based Execution**: Features broken into tasks with incremental verification

## Archived Documentation

Historical documents from earlier development phases (pre-LangGraph):

- [archive/](archive/) - Contains:
  - `delivery-package.md` - Original delivery documentation
  - `orchestrator-impl.md` - Pre-LangGraph implementation details
  - `unified-multi-cli-orchestration.md` - Research artifact for multi-CLI coordination
  - `multi-agent-guide.md` - Pre-LangGraph multi-agent guide
  - `implementation-guide.md` - Legacy phase-based implementation guide

These archived documents are kept for historical reference but do not reflect
the current LangGraph-based workflow architecture.
