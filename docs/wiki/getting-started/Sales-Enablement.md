## 🏆 Key Selling Points (KSPs)

### 1. "Auditability & Compliance" (For Enterprise)
*   *Pain*: "How do I know who wrote this code?"
*   *Pitch*: "Conductor logs every single decision. We can tell you exactly *why* a line of code exists, *which* tests verified it, and *who* approved it (Security Agent). It's a perfect audit trail."

### 2. "Security First" (For CISO/Security)
*   *Pain*: "AI code is full of bugs."
*   *Pitch*: "We use the **4-Eyes Protocol**. Every line of code is reviewed by a dedicated Security AI (Cursor) utilizing the OWASP Top 10 checklist. It's like having a Security Engineer pair-program on every feature."

### 3. "Velocity without Quality Trade-off" (For CTO/VP)
*   *Pain*: "I can have it Fast or Good, but not both."
*   *Pitch*: "We break that triangle. Because we enforce Test-Driven Development (TDD) at the machine level, we get high speed *and* high test coverage simultaneously."

## 🗣️ Objection Handling

**Q: "Is this just ChatGPT writing code?"**
A: "No. ChatGPT is a chatbot. Conductor is an **Orchestration System**. It uses 12 specialized agents (like a Planner, a Tester, a Reviewer) that check each other's work. It's a team, not a chatbox."

**Q: "What if the AI hallucinates?"**
A: "That's why we have the Validator Agents. If the 'Coder' hallucinates a library that doesn't exist, the 'Reviewer' catches it instantly and rejects the code. It never reaches production."

**Q: "Does it replace developers?"**
A: "No, it makes them 'Super-Developers'. One human developer using Conductor can do the work of a team of 5, because they are managing the bots rather than typing the code."
