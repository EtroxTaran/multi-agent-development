# Plan

## When to use

- You have a product mission + docs and need a clear task breakdown.

## Instructions

1. Extract acceptance criteria and constraints.
2. Create tasks (T1..TN) with:
   - user story + criteria
   - files to create/modify
   - tests to add/run
   - dependencies
3. Keep tasks small and parallelizable.
