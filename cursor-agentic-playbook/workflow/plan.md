# Workflow Macro: Plan

---

Use the `/planner` subagent to create an implementation plan from the product docs.

## Requirements
- Tasks T1..TN with acceptance criteria
- File scope per task (create/modify)
- Test plan per task (what tests + commands)
- Dependencies + execution order

Keep tasks small and parallelizable where possible.
